                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Once there was a gardener having a beautiful garden of flower-plants-mostly rose plats. By chance a lily plant blossomed near a rose-bush.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Lily is believed to yield flowers that never fade and have everlasting beauty. But the rose flowers have a short life.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The lily said to the rose, "how beautiful you are! What an aroma you passes! No wonder, you are universally a fvourite flower. I really envy you."</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The rose replied, "You wouldn't have said so, if you knew the reality. My bloom is very short-lived. I bloom in the morning and by sunset I begin to loose shine.
                            By the next morning I fade completely and then I die. But you are known to have flowers that never fade even if they have been cut. Beauty is only a nine-day wonder."

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The mule asked herself, "From whom have I inherited this fatigue?" She thought hard and said to herself, "I must have inherited it from my father who was just a
                            donkey. He used to carry heavy loads and was all the time exhausted."

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The man said, "Look there! Doesn't it prove my point, Mr. Lion?" The lion replied, "It's your view. But if we lion make statues, we shall show the man under the
                            string paws of a lion." The man had no words to reply. So, they both cooled down and moved ahead.</p>
