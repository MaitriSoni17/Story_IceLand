                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Long time ago, there lived a priest who was extremely lazy and poor at the same time. He did not wnat to do any hardwork but used to dream of being rich one day. 
                        He got his food by begging for alms. One morning he got a pot of milk as part of the alms. He was extremely delighted and went home with the pol of milk. He boiled the milk, drank some of it
                        and put the remaining milk in a pot. He added slight curds in the pot for converting the milk to curd. He then lay down to sleep.
                        Soon, he started imaging about the pot of curd while he lay asleep. He dreamed that if he could become rich somehow all this miseries would be gone . His thoughts 
                        turned to the pot of milk he had set from curd. He dreamed on : "By morning the pot of milk would set, it would be converted to curd. I would churn the curd and make butter from it. I would 
                        heat the butter and make ghee out of it.  I will then go to that market and sell that ghee, and make money. With that money I will buy a hen. The hen will lay may eggs which will hatch and there
                        will be many chicken. These chicken will in turn lay hundreds of eggs and I will soon have a poultry farm of my own." He kept on imaging.
                        "I will sell all the hens of my poultry and buy some cows, and open a milk dairy. All the town people will buy milk from me. I will be very rich and soon I 
                            shall buy jewels. The king will buy all the jewels from me. I will be so rich that I will be able to marry an exceptionally beautiful girl from a rich family. Soon I will have a handsome son.
                            If he does any mischief I will be very angry and to teach him a lesson, I will hit him with a big stick." During this dream, he involuntarily picked up the stick nest to his bed and thinking 
                            that he was beating his son, raised the stick and hit the pot. The pot of milk broke and he awoke from his day dream.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda cartoon and pulled it over to the telephone. He climed onto the cartoon so that he could reach the buttons on
                            the phone and procceded to punch in seven digits (phone number). The store-owner observed and listed to the conversation.
                        Boy : 'Lady, Can you give me the job of cutting your lown?'Woman : (At the other end of the phone line) : 'I already have someone to cut my lawn.'Boy : 'Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your lawn now.'
                        woman : 'I'm very satisfied with the perosn who is presently cutting my lawn.'Boy : (With more perseverance) : 'Lady, I'll even sweep your curb and your sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the pretiiest lawn in all of Palm beach, Florida.'
                        Woman : 'No, thank you.'With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver. The store-owner, who was listeing to all this, waled over to the boy.
                        Store Owner : 'Son..I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and would like to offer you a job.'
                        Boy : 'No thanks.'Store Owner : 'But you were really pleading for one.'Boy : 'No, sir, I was just checking my performance at the job I already have. I am the one who is working for that lady I was talking to!'Moral : This is what we call 'Self Appraisal'. Every time if we don't get ahead of others, we blame others for it. We should look to our self and compare, find own
                            weakness and work hard to throw away weakness. Always Work Hard, Honest and with full Dedication. It will always pay up.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">One day, all the employees reached the office and they saw a big advice on the dooe on which it was written : "Yesterday the peroson who has been hindering your
                            growth in this company passed away. We invite you to join the funeral in the room that has been prepared in the gym." IN the beginning, they all got sad for the death of one of his colleagues,
                            but after a while they started getting curioys to know who was that man who hindered the growth of his colleagues and the company itself.
                        The excitement in the gym was such that security agents were ordered to control the crowd within the room. The more people reached the coffin, the more the excitement
                            heated up. Everyone thought : "Who is this guy who was hindering my progress? Wll, at least he died!" ONe by one the thrilled employees got closer to the coffin, and when they looked inside it 
                            they suddenly became speechless. They stood nearby the coffin, shocked and in silence, as if someone had touched the deepest part of their soul. There was a mirror inside the coffin. Everyone who
                            looked inside it could see himself.
                        There was also a sign nest to the mirror that said : "There is only one person who is capable to set limits to your growth : It is YOU." You are the only person who can
                            revolutionize your life. You are the only person who can help yourself. Your life does not change when your boss changes, when your friends change, when your partner changes, when your changes. Your life
                            changes when YOU change, when go beyond your limiting beliefs, when you realize that you are the only one responsible for your life. "The most important relationship you can have in the one you have with
                            yourself."
                        The world is like a mirror : It gives back to anyone the reflection of the thoughts in thich one has strongly believed. The world and your reality are like mirrors lying in a 
                            coffin, which show to any individual the dath of this devine capability to imagine and create his happiness and his success. It's the way you face LIfe that makes the dfference.

                            was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway it jus wasn't worth it to retrive the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and begin to
                            shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted sown. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked
                            down the well and was astonished at what he saw. With every shovel of dirt that fell on his back, the donkey was doing some thing amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's
                            neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up.
                        Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and tootted off!</p>

                            complained and was always in a bad mood.
                        The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious. It was even
                            unnatural and insulting to be happy nest to him.
                        He created the feeling of unhappiness in others.But one day, when he turned eighty years old, and incredible thing happened. INstantly, everyone started hearing the rumout :

                        "Nothing special. Eighty years I've been chasing happiness, and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That's why I'm
