                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">There was a farmar who sold a pound of butter to a baker. One day, the baker decided to weight the butter to see if he was 
                        getting the right amount, which he wasn't. Angry about this, he took the farmar to court.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The judge asked the farmar if he was using any measure to weight the butter. The farmar replied, "Honor, I am primitive. I don't
                        have a proper measure, but I do have a scale."</p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The judge asked, "Then how do you weight the butter?"</p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The farmar replied;</p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">"Your Honor, long before the baker started buying butter from me, I have been buying a pound loaf of a bread from him. Every day 
                        when the baker brings the bread, I put it on the scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it is the baker."</p>

                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Once upon a time, ther was a beautiful rose plant in a garden. One rose flower on the plant was proud of its beauty. However, 
                        it was disappointed that it was growing next to an ugly cactus. Every day, the rose would insult the cactus about its looks, but the cactus stayed quiet.
                        All the other plants in the garden tried to stop the rose from bullying the cactus, but the rose was too swayed by its own beauty to listen to anyone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">One summer, a well in the garden dried up and there was no water for the plants. The rose slowly began to wilt. The rose saw a sparrow dip its break into the 
                        cactus for some water. The rose then felt ashamed for having made fun of the cactus all this time. But because it was in need of water, it went to ask the cactus if it could have some water.
                        The kind cactus agreed, and they both got through summer as friends.

                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Once a huge oak tree stood on the bank of a river. It was well nourished by the water of the river. Naturally, it was well very strong and had a thick stem. Just 
                        nearby, grew some reeds with thin but flexible well too.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">One day, strong wind blew. The tree, though huge and strong, from broke from the middle and was thrown across the stream just among the reeds. On the other hand,
                        the tree was very suprised to see that the reeds suffered no harm at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The oak could not make out the reason of the safety of the reeds and asked them, "How is it that, you being frail and slender, managed to face the gale without 
                        any harm. But I, strong enough, have been broken."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The reeds replied,"You were proud of your strength and refused to bend. So, you broke while we bowed and yieled to the gale and were spared."</p>

                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">It was high summer. The sun was extremely hot. Two travelers were going along a dusty road that had no trees along its sides. Looking for some shelter from the hot
                        sun, they saw a tree with big leaves and branches spread like an umbrella.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">They placed their belongings on the ground and sat in the cool thick shade of the tree. After taking some rest, one traveler said to the other, "What a useless tree it
                        is! It bears no fruits at all."</p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Hearing this, the tree felt pinched and burt out, "You ungrateful soul! On one hand, you are taking shelter in my cool shade from the burning heat of the sun and on the
                        other hand, you are calling me useless. Get up and leave the place immediately to be scorched again."</p>

                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">It was high autumn. An olive tree and a fig tree stood near each other. the fig tree had lost all his leaves and became quite bare. Seeing his neighbour, the 
                        olive tree puffed up with pride.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The olive tree taunted the fig tree, "How unlucky you are! You lose your leaves every autumn to be bare. But I flourish all the year round."</p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The fig tree argued, "Friend! it's my destiny to be bare and yours to be evergreen. But there is nothing to feel small or proud about it. It is out 
                        of control of both of us."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Few days later, there occurred a snow-fall. The snow settled on the leaves of the olive tree and gave way under its heavy weight. But as for the fig tree, 
                        the snow fell to the ground through its bare branches and it survived the snow-strom.
