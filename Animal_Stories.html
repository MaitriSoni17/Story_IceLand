                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Once, a lion was sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down on his body just for fun.
                            This disturbed the lion's sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">"I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me." The lion laughed at the mouse's confidence and let him go.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">One day, a few hunters came into the forest and took the line with them. They tied him up against a tree. The lion was struggling 
                            to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the mouse walked past and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he run and gnawed on the ropes to set the lion free. Both of them sped
                            off into the jungle.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">In a village, lived a carefree boy with his father. The boy's father told him that he was old enough to watch over the 
                            sheep while they graze in the fields and watch them as they graze. Every day, he had to take the sheep to the grassy fields and watch them as they
                            graze. However, the boy was unhappy and didn't want to take the sheep to the fields. He wanted to run and play, not watch the boring sheep graze in
                            the field. So, he decided to have some fun. He cried, "Wolf! Wolf!" until the entire village came running with stones to chase away the wolf before it
                            could eat any of the sheep. When the villagers saw that was no wolf, they left muttering under their breath there to chase the wolf away.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The boy laughed at the fright he had caused. This time, the villages left angrily. The third day, as the boy went up the samall
                            hill, he suddenly saw a wolf attacking his sleep. He cried as hard as he could, "Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!", but not a single villager came to help him. The villagers
                            thought that he was trying to fool them again and did not come to rescue him or sheep. The little boy lost many sheep that day, all because of foolishness.

                            on time and knocked at the door with her long beak. The fox took her to the dinner table and served some soup in a shallow bowls for both of them. As
                            the bowl as too shallow for the stork, she couldn't have soup at all. But, the fox licked up his soup quickly.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">the stork was angry and upset, but she didn't show her anger and behaved politely. To teach a lesson to the fox, she then invited
                            him for dinner the next day. She too served soup, but this time the soup was served in two tall narrow vases. The stork devoured the soup form her vase, but the
                            for couldn't drink any of it because of his narrow neck. The fox realised his mistake and went home famished.

                            saw a river and wad delighted to see it. She climed up on a small rock to drink the water, but she slipped and fell into the river. She was drowing but
                            a dove who was sittinig on a nearby tree helped her. Seeing the ant in troble, the dove quickly dropped a leaf into the water. The ant moved towards the
                            leaft and climed up on it. the dove then carefully pulled the leaf out and placed it on the land. This way, the ant's life was saved and she was forever
                            indebted to the dove.

                            everywhere, but couldn't find anything that he could eat. His stomach was rumbling and his search continued. Soon he reached a vineyard which was laden with juicy grapes. The 
                            fox looked around to check if he was safe from the hunters. No one was around, so he decided to steal some graps. He jumped high and high, but he couldn't reach the grapes. The 
                            grapes were too high but he refused to give up. The fox jumped high in the air to catch the grapes in mouth, but he missed. He tried once more but he missed again. He tried a few more
                            times, but couldn't reach. It was getting dark and the fox was getting angry. His legs hurt, so he gave up in the end. walking away, he said, "I'm sure the graps were sour anyway."
