                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Patty, a milkmaid milked her cow and had two full pails of freash, creamy milk. She put both pails of milk on a stick and set off to the market to sell the milk.
                            As she took steps towards the market, her thoughts took steps towards wealth. On her way, she kept thinking about the money she would make from selling the milk. Then she thought about what
                            she would do with that money.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Soon, he started imaging about the pot of curd while he lay asleep. He dreamed that if he could become rich somehow all this miseries would be gone . His thoughts 
                        turned to the pot of milk he had set from curd. He dreamed on : "By morning the pot of milk would set, it would be converted to curd. I would churn the curd and make butter from it. I would 
                        heat the butter and make ghee out of it.  I will then go to that market and sell that ghee, and make money. With that money I will buy a hen. The hen will lay may eggs which will hatch and there
                        will be many chicken. These chicken will in turn lay hundreds of eggs and I will soon have a poultry farm of my own." He kept on imaging.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">She was talking to herself and said, "Once I get the money, I'll buy a chicken. The chicken will lay eggs and I will get more chickens. They'll all lay eggs, and I will
                            sell them for money money. Then, I'll the house on the hill and everyone will envy me." She was very happy that soon she would be very rich. With these happy thoughts, she marched ahead. But suddenly,
                            she tripped and fell. Both the pails of the milk fell and all her dreams were shattered. The milk split onto the ground, and all Patty could do was cry. "No more dream," she cried foolishly!

                            vessel. He asked Asha to keep an eye on the vessels for about ten to fifteen minutes while the three ingredients in three separate vessels boiled. After the said time, he asked Asha to peel the
                            potato and egg, and strain the tea leaves. Asha was left puzzled - she understood her father was trying to explain her someting, but se didn't know what it was.

                            hard, and the tea leaves changed the colour and taste of the water. He further said, "We are like one of these items. When adversity calls, we respond exactly the way they do. Now, are you a potato, an

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Nasir, a small boy, found a crystal ball behind the banyan tree of his garden. The tree told him that it would grant him a wish. He was very happy and he thought 
                            hard, but unfortunately, he could not come up with anything he wanted. So, he kept the crystal ball in his bag and waited until he could decide on his wish.

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Days went by without him making a wish but his best friend saw him looking at the crystal ball. He stole it from Nasir and showed it to everyone in the village. They
                            all asked for palaces and riches and lots of gold, but could not make more than one wish. In the end, everyone was angry because no one could have everything they wanted. They became very unhappy
                            and decided to ask Nasir for help. Nasir wished that everything would go back to how it was once - before the villagers had tried to satisfy their greed. The palaces and gold vanished and the 
                            villagers once again became happy and content.
