                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">One day, Bunny rabbit heard the loud barking of the wild dogs. He was very scared. He decided to ask for help. He quickly went to his friend's deer. He said : 
                            "Dear fiend, some wild dogs are chasing me. Can you chase them away with your sharp antlers?" Deer said : "That is right, I can. But now I am busy. Why don't you ask a bear for help?"

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Bunny rabbit ran to the bear. "My dear friend you are very strong, please help me. Some wild dogs are after me. Please chase them away." he requested to the bear.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Bear replied, "I am sorry. I am hungry and tired. I need to find some food. Please ask the monkey for help."</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Poor Bunny went to the monkey, elephant, goat and all his friends. Bunny felt sad that nobody was ready to help him.</p>

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">But as the wolf moved, the poor animal saw him and ran for its life. The wolf chased it but couldn't catch it. The lamb entered a temple and felt quite
                            safe there.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The wolf felt very disappointed and called out to the lamb. Putting on a loving look, he said, "It's unsafe for you to stay inside the temple. The priest will
                            catch you and scrifice you before the gods."

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Saying inside, the lamb replied, "Thanks a lot for your advice, Mr. Wolf. I would prefer to stay inside and be sacrificed on the alar rather than coming
                            out and satisfy your appetite."</p>
                            <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The wolf had no words to say and went away glum and grumpy.</p>

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Once upon a time, three sons were engaged in mercantile business under supervision of their father. They were very rich. Each son was proficient in his own
                            department.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">If one was good in sales, the other one was competent in purchases and similarly the third one in finace.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Unluckily, one day the father got bedridden and the sons decided to divide the business under the fallacy that each of them was experts in their own way and can
                            handle their indivisual business solely.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The father was glum and grumpy with their decision but was helpless and unfortunately, the separation took place.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">As a result, the three of them became each other's competitors. With the passage of time, they started having huge losses in their respective businesses. They
                            tried all possible ways to succeed but the situation became worse.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Then they came to their father for a piece of advice. The father said, "When you all wre doing the business jointly, the business ran successfully. But it was
                            not any one of you responsible for the success of the business rather than traits of all three of you put together made the business successful."
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The sons realized their mistake; got reunited. We conclude that disunity always ruins.</p>

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Once upon a time, there was a hungry fox that was looking for something to eat. He was hungry. No matter how hard he tired, the fox could not find food. Finally,
                            he went to the edge of the forest and searched there for food. Suddenly, he caught sight of a big tree with a hole in it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Inside the hole was a package. The hungry fox immediately thought that there might be food in it, and he became very happy. He jumped into the hole and when he 
                            opened the package, he saw there was a lot of food, bread, meat, and fruit in it!
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">An old woodcutter had placed the food in the tree trunk while he cut down trees in the forest. He was going to eat it for lauch.</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The fox happily began to eat. After the fox finished eating, he felt thirsty and decided to leave the trunk and drink some water from a nearby spring. However, no 
                            matter how hard he tried, he could not get out of the hole. Do you know why? Yes, the fos had eaten so much food that he became too big to fit through the hole.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The fox was very sad and upset. He told himself, "I wish that I had thought a little before jumping into the hole."</p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">Yes, children, this is the result of doing something without thinking about it first.</p>

                        <hr class="divider divider-light" />

                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his kness trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon,
                            and split the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth. His son and his son's wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind
                            the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears. Once, too, his trembling hands
                            could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of
                            which he had to eat.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. 'What are you doing there?' asked the
                            father. 'I am making a little trough', answered the child, 'for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.'
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-primary-75 mb-4">The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with
                            them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything.
